		<en-US>When a City's {YIELD_GROWTH}Growth bar fills up, a new link(CONCEPT_CITIZEN) becomes available. {YIELD_GROWTH}Growth also determines how fast a City can produce Civilian Units, such as link(UNIT_SETTLER,2) and link(UNIT_WORKER,2). While a City produces a Unit that requires {YIELD_GROWTH}Growth, its {YIELD_GROWTH}Growth bar no longer fills.</en-US>

		<en-US>Cities produce link(CONCEPT_SPECIALIST,2) and link(CONCEPT_PROJECT,2) with their {YIELD_CIVICS}Civics. Unused {YIELD_CIVICS}Civics go into the Global stockpile, which can be used to enact Laws, establish link(CONCEPT_THEOLOGY,2), link(CONCEPT_HURRY), perform Missions like link(MISSION_PACIFY_CITY), and other uses. You can stockpile a maximum of int(MAX_CIVICS) {YIELD_CIVICS}Civics, with excess converted into {YIELD_SCIENCE}link(YIELD_SCIENCE). Increase {YIELD_CIVICS}Civics by building certain projects and enact certain Laws. Members of your link(CONCEPT_COURT) with high link(RATING_CHARISMA) also contribute to the global {YIELD_CIVICS}Civics stockpile.</en-US>

		<en-US>When a City's {YIELD_CULTURE}Culture bar fills up, a positive Event occurs, and the City's overall {YIELD_CULTURE}Culture Level increases. The four {YIELD_CULTURE}Culture Levels are link(CULTURE_WEAK), link(CULTURE_DEVELOPING), link(CULTURE_STRONG), and link(CULTURE_LEGENDARY). {YIELD_CULTURE}Culture Level affects which link(CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENT,2) can be built in a City's territory and whether the City can link(CONCEPT_HURRY), which requires at least link(CULTURE_DEVELOPING) {YIELD_CULTURE}Culture. Cities with higher {YIELD_CULTURE}Culture levels also cost additional link(YIELD_LOCAL_MATERIAL,1) per link(CONCEPT_POPULATION). Ways to increase a City's {YIELD_CULTURE}Culture yield include building certain projects, training certain link(CONCEPT_SPECIALIST,2), spreading a link(CONCEPT_RELIGION) to a City, and adopting certain Laws.</en-US>

		<en-US>Cities slowly gain {YIELD_DISCONTENT}Discontent over time. When a City's {YIELD_DISCONTENT}Discontent bar fills up, its overall {YIELD_DISCONTENT}Discontent Level goes up by one, which reduces link(YIELD_GROWTH,1), link(YIELD_LOCAL_MATERIAL,1), link(YIELD_MANPOWER,1), link(YIELD_SPICE,1), link(YIELD_FUEL,1), link(YIELD_SCIENCE,1) and link(YIELD_OFFWORLD_SUPPLIES,1) and also increases link(YIELD_MAINTENANCE,1). Higher {YIELD_DISCONTENT}Discontent Levels also reduce the link(CONCEPT_OPINION_FAMILY,3) of the City's ruling link(CONCEPT_FAMILY). Some ways to slow {YIELD_DISCONTENT}Discontent include connecting your City with the link(CONCEPT_TRADE_NETWORK), holding a link(PROJECT_FESTIVAL), adopting Laws such as link(LAW_TOLERANCE) and keeping a City's link(CONCEPT_RELIGION,2) happy.</en-US>

They are also needed for such actions as assigning link(CONCEPT_GOVERNOR,2) and sending link(CONCEPT_COUNCILOR,2) on Missions. Unused {YIELD_ORDERS}Orders are sold for link(YIELD_MONEY,1) at the end of the Turn. Your {YIELD_ORDERS}Orders rate can be increased by improving your link(CONCEPT_LEGITIMACY).</en-US>
